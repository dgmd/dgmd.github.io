        One of the most common mistakes in programs like this is not asking for <em>enough</em> help and/or not asking for help <em>enough</em>. Small, frequent course corrections (whether on choosing a project, debugging an exercise, or just wrapping your head around a new concept) are more fun and more likely to succeed and avoid the frustration of banging your head against a wall too long. So, please find a way to reach out!

        To answer technical questions, you might look to the internet in general as well as our <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/tools-and-materials/">Tools & Materials</a> page first.  
    </li>
    <li>
        If you can't find an answer there, or if you have other, course-specific questions, please feel free to post to our <a href="http://slack.com">Slack channel</a>.

        If none of that works, or you hate mediated communication, you can always <b>come to one of our Saturday studio sessions</b>, 9AM-1PM at Clover in Harvard Square or <b>join us after each class session at Felipe's</b> in Harvard where we will be available to continue conversations and answer questions after we are kicked out of the Brattle Street space at 10PM.
