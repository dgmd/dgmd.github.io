        One of the most common mistakes in programs like this is not asking for <em>enough</em> help and/or not asking for help <em>enough</em>. Small, frequent course corrections (whether on choosing a project, debugging an exercise, or just wrapping your head around a new concept) are more fun and more likely to succeed and avoid the frustration of banging your head against a wall too long. So, please find a way to reach out!

        To answer technical questions, you might look to the internet in general as well as our <a href="http://dgmds15.github.io/tools-and-materials/">Tools & Materials</a> page first.

        If you can't find an answer there, or if you have other, course-specific questions, please feel free to post to our <a href="http://slack.com">Slack channel</a>.
