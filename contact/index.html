        One of the most common mistakes in programs like this is not asking for <em>enough</em> help and/or not asking for help <em>enough</em>. Small, frequent course corrections (whether on choosing a project, debugging an exercise, or just wrapping your head around a new concept) are more fun and more likely to succeed. So, please find a way to reach out!

        If your question is technical—<i>i.e.</i> if we would benefit from seeing your code (and it's failure or success) please <a href='https://guides.github.com/features/issues/'>file an Issue</a>. You can read more in the GitHub section of <a href='https://guides.github.com/features/issues/'>Tools &amp; Materials</a>.
