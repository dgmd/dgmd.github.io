    Making things requires tools. And the same surfeit of tools that makes it possible for us to make all sorts of neat stuff—digitally and physically—also can make it pretty overwhelming to get up and running. This page begins to document some of those tools and a handful of selected resources we think will make getting started easier.
</p>
<p>
    A <em>remarkable</em> amount of making things is about setting up your environment and tooling. While it's wonderful and amazing how many different people and communities make the making of digital and physical stuff easier, that diversity introduces a lot of complexity. It is natural to be overwhelmed by all this. All we can say is that we feel that each of these tools [pretty quickly] end up being worth it. It's amazing how much the experience sucks, given how much rides on building things with technology.
</p>
<p>
    If you are really into tooling and want to take a bit of a meandering jaunt through what's out there and why you might choose to use which things for what, feel free to read <a href="long-story.html">The Long Story</a>. The rest of this page will focus on what you will need to install and familiarize yourself within the scope of this course.

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>personal site &amp; journal set-up</h3>
