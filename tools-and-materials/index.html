    Making things requires tools. And the same surfeit of tools that makes it possible for us to make all sorts of neat stuff—digitally and physically—also can make it pretty overwhelming to get up and running. This page begins to document some of those tools and a handful of selected resources we think will make getting started easier.
</p>

<p>
    A <em>remarkable</em> amount of making things is about setting up your environment and tooling. While it's wonderful and amazing how many different people and communities make the making of digital and physical stuff easier, that diversity introduces a lot of complexity. It is natural to be overwhelmed by all this. All we can say is that we feel that each of these tools [pretty quickly] end up being worth it. It's amazing how much the experience sucks, given how much rides on building things with technology.

<p>
    If you are really into tooling and want to take a bit of a meandering jaunt through what's out there and why you might choose to use which things for what, feel free to read <a href="long-story.html">The Long Story</a>. The rest of this page will focus on what you will need to install and familiarize yourself within the scope of this course.

        You will need to download a lot of stuff to do work in this course.  Here's a quick list of some general software you should install on your machine: 
        <ul>
            <li>Get an <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple ID</a>.</li>
            <li>Install <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode Developer Tools</a>.</li>

            <li>Create a <a href="http://github.com">Github account</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Some of the first projects and exercises we'll do in class will require a few more installations and account set-ups.
        <ol>
            <li><b>/people page project</b>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Create an account at <a href="http://codepen.io">Codepen.io</a>.</li>
                    <li>Fork <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">this Codepen</a> and modify it to reflect information about yourself.</li>
                    <li>Now, add some CSS or Javascript effects to your card.  Check out <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/people">our current people page</a> or <a href='https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e'>this list of effects</a> for inspiration on how to adapt your card.</li>
                    <li>When you're done with your card, export it as a Github gist, and post the link on your personal Github Pages site.  From there, we'll incorporate it into the class website.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>personal site & journal set-up</b>: Create a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> site for your username using the linked instructions.  This site will serve as your daily journal and portfolio during the class.</li>
            <li><b>a-story-in-pomes project</b>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/dgmd/a-story-in-pomes">a-story-in-pomes</a> repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper left.</li> 
                    <li>Next, clone it from your Github account by typing <code>git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/a-story-in-pomes.git</code> into your terminal.</li>  
                    <li>Now, type <code>http-server a-story-in-pomes</code> in your terminal.</li>  
                    <li>You should now be able see the site by going to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/</a> in Google Chrome.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
