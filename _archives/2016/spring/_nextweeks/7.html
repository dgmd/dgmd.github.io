	<li>Post your mock-up along with notes from your discussion during today's share-out to your journal with enough context for it to make sense to us, even if we weren't sitting at the same table as you.</li>
	<li>If it's not already a part of your mock-up from #1, share a description, sketch, or prototype—depending on where you're at—of the next thing you'd like to build for your project in your journal.</li>
	<li>Consider whether there are any technical obstacles we can help with standing between you and accomplishing that next step.  If so, <a href='mailto:dgmde15@gmail.com'>ask us</a> to meet up and/or <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UbHIuz9z0mrNZYNnx53Lh8SqQEQVGuahW_EYJtFyjzc/viewform'>request a code snippet!</a></li>
