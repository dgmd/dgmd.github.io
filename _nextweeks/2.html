	<li>Implement an effect for your partner's card in Codepen and submit the URL to us by Wednesday at midnight, so we have time to incorporate people's cards before next session. At a minimum, you should have their name, a picture, and basic information in the card you share. We can always add a new effect down the line, if you haven't quite gotten it working how you want; just be sure to submit <i>something</i> to represent them on the site by next week.</li>

	<li>Update your journal with notes from any brainstorms you engage in, documentation of any problems you encounter, digital artifacts you're inspired by, mockups you create, etc.</li>

	<li>Take a look at the `pomes` project. Articulate any questions, look at extensions, and begin poking around in the HTML/CSS/JS files. Next week, we'll be looking under the hood of this project a bit more.</li>

    <li>Submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UbHIuz9z0mrNZYNnx53Lh8SqQEQVGuahW_EYJtFyjzc/viewform">code snippet request</a> for anything you'd like some coding guidance for in your /people card, the <code>pomes</code> extensions, or your personal project</li>

    <li>Send us <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fiI1SlP0mUPwBVL8gL3lhiunJMx4B1voQBdXz-VXoNs/viewform">feedback</a> about this session, if anything struck you as run particularly well or poorly. (Feedback is anonymous.)</li>
