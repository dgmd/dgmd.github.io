	<li><b>By Sunday evening</b>: Post a link to a digital thing you love to your journal. Whether you think it's beautiful, clever, powerful, hilarious, etc. </li>

	<li><b>By Monday's session</b>: Finish setting up a DGMD S-15 journal using GitHub pages. You can style them as little or much as you'd like. <a href="http://awinchestermaria.github.io/">Here</a> <a href="http://ktbee.github.io/">are</a> <a href="http://suzicurran.github.io/">some</a> <a href="http://laura-guillen.github.io/">journals</a> by last semester's participants.
    
    <li><b>By Monday's session</b>: Finish a first draft of your partner's <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">/people card</a> including at least their name, a new picture, and their GitHub username. Post it to your journal! You should also take a go at implementing the effect to represent them, looking at <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/archives/2016/spring/people/">the people page</a> on last semester's class site for some ideas or <a href="https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e">this library of basic effects</a> for inspiration.</li>

    <li><b>By Monday's session</b>: Finish setting up your local development environment by following <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/tools-and-materials#materials-for-this-course">these steps</a>. If you run into trouble, don't stress (or stay up all night). We'll be available to make sure you're set up. We'll be using many of these tools Monday, so please reach out before then if you are having any trouble!
