	<li>Post a mock-up (or story map or spec) and description of your personal project to your journal. If you aren't yet feeling generative, please get in touch with us to brainstorm! (We don't want you to work on something you think is lame!)</li>

	<li>Take a go at messing around with the <code>pomes</code> project, whether with the extensions we've suggested or by making it your own in your own way.</li>
    
    <li>Submit a <a href="https://dgmd.typeform.com/to/MhtHpD">Code Snippet Request</a> or get in touch <a href="http://dgmd.herokuapp.com/">on Slack</a> if you have any trouble!</li> 

    <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0.25em; margin-top: 0.25em;'>If you just want some more stuff to explore...</h3>
    
    <li>If you want to get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you might check out the <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/tools-and-materials">Tools &amp; Materials</a> page. We suggest starting with <a href="https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro">our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS</a>. Then, we recommend Shay Howe's <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS</a> and the online book series <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don't Know JS</a>.</li>
