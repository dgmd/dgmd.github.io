<ol style='margin-top: 1em;'>
	<li>Post your code from today to your journal along with your black box diagram and any other notes and materials you used. If there's more work you'd like to do on the sketch, just post an update and share the piece when it's done.</li>

	<li>In addition, brainstorm some physical inputs you think might make for an interesting visualization using one of the sketches we looked at today. Post these — along with any questions — in your journal.</li>

	<li>Finally, please also answer the usual questions in your journal: 
		<ol>
			<li>What did you accomplish today?</li>
			<li>What do you aim to have done by next session?</li>
			<li>What can we (the teaching team) do to help?</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>If you took a microcontroller home, take some time to get it set up on your machine and mess around with it before Wednesday's session.</li>

    <li>If you get stuck, submit a <a href="https://dgmd.typeform.com/to/MhtHpD">Code Snippet Request</a> or get in touch <a href="http://dgmd.herokuapp.com/">on Slack</a> if you have any trouble!</li>
</ol>
