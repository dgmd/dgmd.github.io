	<li>Make <em>at least</em> three sketches representing effects you'd like to add to your partner's card and have them choose one to represent them on the course website. Come in with all of your mockups and your partner's decision on Wednesday.</li>
    
    <li>We'll be using <a href='https://slack.com/'>Slack</a> (tour <a href='https://slack.com/is'>here</a>) as our course chat room, which you can join <a href='https://dgmd.herokuapp.com/'>here</a>.</li>

    <li>Take a go at setting up up your local development environment by following <a href="tools-and-materials#materials-for-this-course">the steps here</a>. If you run into trouble, don't stress (or stay up all night). We'll be available to make sure you're set up and we won't be using some of these tools for a week or so.
    </li>

    <h3>If you just want some more stuff to explore...</h3>
    
    <li>Check out <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">our /people card template</a> and start transforming it to represent your partner. Make your own account, <code>fork</code> our sketch, and replace Kanye with your partner, adding a CSS or Javascript effect of your own. You can look at <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/archives/2016/spring/people/">the people page</a> on last semester's class site for some ideas or use <a href="https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e">this library of basic effects</a> for inspiration.</li>

    <li>If you find you are wanting help getting started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you work through the <code>/people</code> activity, you might check out the <a href="tools-and-materials">Tools &amp; Materials</a> page of our course site. You might also begin with MDN's introductions to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS">CSS</a> and Shay Howe's <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS</a>. We'll also be digging into <a href="https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro">our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS</a>, which might be of particular use.</li>
