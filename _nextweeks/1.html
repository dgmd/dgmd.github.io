	<li>Make <em>at least</em> three sketches representing effects you'd like to add to your partner's card and have them choose one to represent them on the course website. We'll be posting them to a personal journal hosted on <a href='http://github.com'>GitHub</a>, which we'll ask you to use as your central place for keeping materials.  If you'd like to get a headstart, check out <a href='/sessions/1/#/8'>these directions</a>.</li>
    
    <li>We'll be using <a href='https://slack.com/'>Slack</a> (tour <a href='https://slack.com/is'>here</a>) as our course chat room, which you can join <a href='https://dgmd.herokuapp.com/'>here</a>.</li>

    <li>Take a go at setting up up your local development environment by following <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/tools-and-materials#materials-for-this-course">these steps</a>. If you run into trouble, don't stress (or stay up all night). We'll be available to make sure you're set up.

    <li>Check out <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">our /people card template</a> and start transforming it to represent your partner. Make your own account, <code>fork</code> our sketch, and replace Kanye with your partner, adding a CSS or Javascript effect of your own. You can look at <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/archives/2016/spring/people/">the people page</a> on last semester's class site for some ideas or use <a href="https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e">this library of basic effects</a> for inspiration.</li>

    <li>If you want to get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you might check out the <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/tools-and-materials">Tools &amp; Materials</a> page and Shay Howe's <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS</a>. We'll also be digging into <a href="https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro">our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS</a>, which might be of particular use.</li>
