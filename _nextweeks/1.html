    <li>Set up up your local development environment by following <a href="https://dgmd.github.io/tools-and-materials">the steps here</a>.
    </li>
    
    <li>Check out <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">this HTML/CSS/Javascript sketch</a> and take a look at our version of a digital business card. Make your own account, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/"><code>fork</code></a> our sketch, and replace Kanye with your partner, adding a CSS or Javascript effect of your own. You can look at <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/people">the people page</a> on the current class site for some ideas or use <a href="https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e">this library of basic effects</a> for inspiration.</li>

    <li>If you find you are wanting help getting started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you work through the <code>/people</code> activity, you might check out the <a href="tools-and-materials">Tools &amp; Materials</a> page of our course site. You might also begin with MDN's introductions to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS">CSS</a> and Shay Howe's <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS</a>. We'll also be digging into <a href="https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro">our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS</a>, which might be of particular use.</li>
    
    <li>When you're really <em>done</em> with your contribution to the <code>people</code> page, share the link to your Codepen with us by emailing <code>dgmde15@gmail.com</code> <em>and</em> a link to your GitHub Pages journal.</li>
    
    <li>We'll be looking a little more in depth at <a href="https://github.com/dgmd/a-story-in-pomes"><code>a-story-in-pomes</code></a>, so you might take a look at <a href="http://dgmd.github.io/a-story-in-pomes/">the deployed version</a> to get a feel before we dig into its nuts &amp; bolts.</li>
