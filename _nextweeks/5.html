	<li>In your journal, answer these questions: 
		<ol>
			<li>What did you accomplish today?</li>
			<li>What do you aim to have done by next session?</li>
			<li>What can we (the teaching team) do to help</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>Work to actually accomplish the goal you set for yourself.</li>
    
    <li>If you get stuck, submit a <a href="https://dgmd.typeform.com/to/MhtHpD">Code Snippet Request</a> or get in touch <a href="http://dgmd.herokuapp.com/">on Slack</a> if you have any trouble!</li> 

    <li>Please read <a href="https://gist.github.com/duffles/61c0b0b23c2e0e247cc559895e769996">these pair programming articles</a> before next session. Often people think pair programming will go more slowly than "just" doing it yourself. Often this is not true. We encourage you to reach out to friends and acquaintences in the class, through Slack if you'd like, to pair program over the break and weekend.</li>
