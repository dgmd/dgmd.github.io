    <h2>Pair Programming with the Browser-based Cube</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Get our <a href='https://github.com/dgmde15/3D-GIF'>the browser-based interface</a> for the L3D cube set up locally on your computer.</li>
        <li>Find a partner and try out some of these extensions to the existing interface:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the 'LEDs' fade as they move back through the slices of the cube.</li>
            <li>Make an 'LED' disappear after it reaches the back slice.</li>
            <li>Create a new piece of the interface with which you can send a letter through the cube by pressing the corresponding key on your keyboard, e.g. sending a large "L" through the cube by pressing the "L" button.</li>
            <li>Find a way to save the state of your browser-based cube so you can access it later.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h2>For next week:</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol style="font-size: 0.875em;">
        <li>Mess around with the extensions to the browser-based l3D interface.  See if you can get them working, and let us know if you run into challenges.</li>
        
        <li>Explore the materials on Discourse about digital art-,art-making, and LED art.  Come in next week with some ideas of digital art project(s) you'd like to make and some sense of why they're exciting to you.</li>
        
        <li>Share your 2+2 (you can read more on sharing your 2+2's <a href='http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3'>here</a>)</li>
        
        <li>A reminder: Each week, we'd love <a href='dgmde15.github.io/feedback'>your feedback</a> on the session!</li>
