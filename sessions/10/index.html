        <p>We care less about the technical details behind what you've made over the past 2 months and more about how you got there and where you're going.

        <ol style='width: 100%; margin-top: 0.75em;'>
            <li>What did you accomplish today?</li>
            <li>What do you aim to have done by next session?</li>
