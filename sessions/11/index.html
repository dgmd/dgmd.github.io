    <ol>
        <li>Set up the <a href="https://tessel.io/docs/cli">Tessel REPL</a>, a command line interface for interacting with the Tessel.</li>
        <li>Try toggling and otherwise controlling the four LEDs on the Tessel board using the REPL.</li>
        <li>Display the numbers 0–15 using the LEDs on the Tessel board as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary counter</a> (you can read more about base systems <a href='http://betterexplained.com/articles/numbers-and-bases/'>here</a>)</li>
        <li>Blink an LED directly plugged into the Tessel by connecting one leg to GND and another to a GPIO pin which you set HIGH and LOW</li>
        <li>Turn the LED on/off by pressing a button</li>
        <li>Use an LED <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/LEDs-as-light-sensors/">as a light sensor</a> and log its reading to the terminal at regular intervals</li>
        <li>Blink the LEDs in (3) or (4) proportional to the light reading from (6)</li>
        <li>Log out the readings from one of the modules that interest you in the terminal</li>
