    <h2>What didn't work?  How could we make things better?</h2>
    <p>
        A few things we're especially interested in:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>What technical resources (<i>e.g.</i> projects and extensions, 1:1 time, screencasts, MDN) did you actually use?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In retrospect, what was something (or several sometihngs) on which we wasted your time?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What do you think we could do which would lead to people <em>doing</em> more earlier?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>How did the tension between structure, incentives, and our interest in helping you accomplish something <em>you</em> are actually interested in played out for you?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
