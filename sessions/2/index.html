        What's something you've come across recently that you loved and <i>wish</i> you'd made?
    </p>

    <p>
        What's an idea for a project you might actually make and think would be necessary, useful, or beautiful to someone?

    <h2>Sharing your 2+2's</h2>
    <p>
        <em>If</em> you're comfortable, we recommend creating a new GitHub repository named <code>$USERNAME.github.io</code>—where <code>$USERNAME</code> is your GitHub username—and placing a <a href='https://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/'>Markdown file</a> in it named <code>sketchbook.md</code>, where you can record your project ideas and inspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
        That said, we mostly want you to share your ideas with us in a form and format easy and comfortable for you. Meaning if you prefer a Google Doc (or email), that's fine by us too. The <code>$USERNAME.github.io</code> repository just makes it easy to later leverage <a href='https://pages.github.com/'>GitHub's Pages infrastructure</a>, if you so desire.
    </p>
    <p>
        If and when you're interested in sharing your ideas and inspirations with the rest of the class (for discussion, critique, or feedback), please do so on the Disource forum <a href='http://104.236.253.62/t/final-project-ideas/29/4'>here</a> (for project ideas) and <a href='http://104.236.253.62/t/real-world-inspirations/30'>here</a> (for inspirations).
