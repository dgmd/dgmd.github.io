    <h3>How the next 3 weeks will work.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>3 weeks isn't a long time to build something. As people who took the semester-long version of this course can attest, we felt rushed with more than 15 weeks.  In order to make the most of your time with us, we ask that you try to immerse yourself in the language and approaches of programming.  We think this will require that you are:</p> 
    <hr>
    <ol>
    <li>brainstorming and publishing project inspirations, ideas, and refinements on your Github pages site every day</li>
    <li>writing code--for your own projects or extensions and exercises from class--and pushing it to Github every day</li>
    <li>meeting weekly milestones for your personal project, including:
        <ul style="font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
        <li><b>Week 1</b> :: Finish a description, specification, and timeline for your final project</li>
        <li><b>Week 2</b> :: Create a project demo, including description of what's left to finish for your final project</li>
        <li><b>Week 3</b> :: Finish a first version of your final project</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p style='font-size:24px;'>To get all these tools under your belt, take your first stab at using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we are going to populate the people page of the course website with information about ourselves.</p>
    <hr>
    <ol style='width:30%; float:left; font-size:22px;'>
    <li>Create an account at <a href="http://codepen.io">Codepen.io</a>.</li>
    <li>Fork <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">this Codepen</a> and modify it to be about you.</li>
    <li>Now, add some CSS or Javascript effects to your card.  Check out <a href="http://dgmds15.github.io/people">our current people page</a> or <a href='https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e'>this list of effects</a> for inspiration on how to adapt your card.</li>
    <li>When you're done with your card, export it as a Github gist & post the link on your Github Pages site.  We'll incorporate it into the class site from there.</li>

    <hr>
    <p style='font-size:24px;'>To get you thinking about what is possible with these digital tools and what it looks like to design something for another person, we will be looking at this sample project, presented as a gift last year.  To look at its insides you will need to:</p>
    <hr>
    <ol style='font-size:22px;'>
    <li>Fork the the git repository by clicking the button in the upper right of <a href="https://github.com/dgmds15/a-story-in-pomes">this page</a>.</li> 
    <li>Now, clone the project by typing `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/a-story-in-pomes.git` at your terminal.</li>
    <li>Change directory into the repository by typing `cd a-story-in-pomes` at your terminal.</li>
    <li>From inside the directory, run `git checkout gh-pages` to switch to the active branch of the project.</li>
    <li>Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.  You should now be able to go to the url "localhost:8000" in Google Chrome to view the website.</li>
    <li>Now, if you make changes to the project, you will see them reflected when you refresh this local page, but you will not effect the online version of the project.  Try this out by opening the files you downloaded and changing one of the files.</li>
