    <h3>What makes for specifying a good project?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Who's the audience?</li>
        <li>What does the audience value or appreciate?</li>
        <li>How would you be able to tell whether your project was successful (for the audience)?</li>
        <li>What would differentiate a high-quality from a low-quality (but "successful") version of your project?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        As you brainstorm project ideas and/or flesh out your own project idea, set up <a href='https://pages.github.com'>your personal GitHub page</a> (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiOgz3nKpgk'>here</a> is a reasonable tutorial) to use as a journal. <a href='https://gist.github.com/aresnick/11ff4be3cf5b861c4748'>This collection of reflections on stories and storytelling</a> might also help to make concrete some of these questions—

    <h3>21 is a small number</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class='summary'>It's easy to end up feeling rushed with fifteen weeks, much less three. To make the most of our time, try to immerse yourself in actually programming and working on your project(s). That can look different for different folks, but here are a few litmus tests…</p>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Every day</em> you find yourself brainstorming and drafting project inspirations, ideas, and refinements and sharing via your GitHub Pages site</li>
        <li><em>Every day</em> you find yourself writing code—for your own projects or extensions and exercises from class—and pushing it to Github</li>
        <li>Each week, you find yourself making comfortable progress toward weekly milestones for your personal project:
            <ul style="font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
                <li><em>Week 1</em> — Finishing a description, specification, and rough plan for tackling your final project</li>
                <li><em>Week 2</em> — Completing a rough demo, including describingf what you want to refine in the last week</li>
                <li><em>Week 3</em> — Completing a first version of your final project and drafting your a description of your next milestone and the rough steps you need to complete to get there</li>
            </ul>

    <p style='font-size:24px;'>To get you thinking about what is possible with these digital tools and what it looks like to design something for another person, we will be looking at this sample project, presented as a gift last year. To look at its insides you will need to:</p>
    <hr>
    <ol style='font-size:22px;'>
        <li>Fork the the git repository by clicking <code>Fork</code> in the upper right of <a href="https://github.com/dgmds15/a-story-in-pomes">the repository page</a>.</li>
        <li>Now, clone the project by copying the at your terminal. If you're having trouble finding this, check out <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S_526C8Gkw'>this video</a> on forking a repository.</li>
        <li>Change directory into the repository by typing <code>cd a-story-in-pomes</code> at your terminal.</li>
        <li>From inside the directory, run <code>git checkout gh-pages</code> to switch to the active branch of the project.</li>
        <li>Run <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>. You should now be able to go to the url <a href='http://localhost:8000'><code>localhost:8000</code></a> in Google Chrome to view the website.</li>
        <li>Now, if you make changes to the project, you will see them reflected when you refresh this local page, but you will not effect the online version of the project.</li>
