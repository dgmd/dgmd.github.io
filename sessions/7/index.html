            <h3 id="warning-signs">Warning Signs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You sit down to work, and you consistently find yourself distracted.</li>
                <li>You don't know anyone personally who would benefit from what you want to make.</li>
                <li>You think that a &quot;class project&quot; (or &quot;app&quot; or &quot;art project&quot;) has to look or sound a certain way and so reject ideas of yours before they have a chance to grow.</li>
                <li>You <em>want to want</em> or <em>think you should want</em> to do your project.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class='solutions'>
            <h3 id="solutions">Solutions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Schedule a time to sit down with one of us to brainstorm your project, interests, and goals for the course!</li>
                <li>Take one-off ideas which pique your interest seriously, even if they don't seem like a &quot;good project.&quot;</li>
                <li>Don't worry about the relative technical complexity of the project. In our experience, doing anything real is hard enough, and even small tweaks can incur plenty of technical work, if that's a priority for you.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Because it's uncomfortable to not know things (much less ask for help), you instead spend more time planning, imagining, worrying about problems two- and three- and four- steps ahead.</li>
                <li>You say to yourself, &quot;I need to learn more about <em>X</em> before I can start.&quot;</li>
                <li>You haven't yet made any small things or attempts on the path toward sculpting your initial prototype.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Give yourself permission to throw things away. You might code something that you don't ultimately put into your final project. That's OK.</li>
                <li>If you're not sure how to come up with something to code that's more specific than "my project," talk to us!</li>
                <li>Figure out a regular practice (of sharing mockups, articulating the next thing you need to code, collecting all your open technical and/or design questions, whatever will be helpful to you).</li>

                <li>You haven't ended a session lost in the process of getting something to work or had the experience of finally getting that thing to work the next day or week or...</li>

                <li>Ask to sit down and just play and explore—we <em>love</em> just sitting down to sketch and brainstorm together, more like a jam session than a tennis lesson.</li>

                <li>And then maybe post in the <a href='https://dgmd.slack.com'>DGMD Slack channel</a>! Or <a href='mailto:dgmde15@gmail.com'>email us</a>!  Or just ask to get together with us and work through the topic—not even addressing your problem directly.</li>
