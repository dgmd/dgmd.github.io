    <h2>Refining Letterpress</h2>
    <p>
        Added scoring, surrounding, and preventing the play of previously played words. Some suggested (and final, for the purely digital version) extensions:

        <li><a href='https://github.com/dgmde15/Letterpress#make-it-possible-to-reset-pieces-individually'>Add the ability to <em>individually</em> reset pieces and send them back to the board both by clicking and dragging them</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://github.com/dgmde15/Letterpress#make-it-possible-to-re-order-and-re-shuffle-individual-played-tiles'>Add the ability to re-order and re-shuffle played tiles without needing to reset the entire tray.</a></li>

    <h2>Don't let this happen to you!</h2>

        <a href='https://webapps.fas.harvard.edu/course_evaluation_reports/dce/view_comments.html?course_id=38420&qid=16076&sect_num='>If we were to begin our final projects at the beginning of the course, we would have more time to complete and perfect them. The final project changed everything for me, because I could get really passionate about solving problems on the way to achieving a vision I was excited about.</a>
