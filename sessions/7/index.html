            <ul>
                <li>You sit down to work, and you consistently find yourself distracted.</li>
                <li>You don't know anyone personally who would benefit from what you want to make.</li>
                <li>You think that a &quot;class project&quot; (or &quot;app&quot; or &quot;art project&quot;) has to look or sound a certain way and so reject ideas of yours before they have a chance to grow.</li>
                <li>You <em>want to want</em> to do your project.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Schedule a time to sit down with one of us to brainstorm your project, interests, and goals for the course!</li>
                <li>Take one-off ideas and interests which pique you seriously, even if they don't seem like a &quot;good project.&quot;</li>
                <li>Don't worry about the relative technical complexity of the project. In our experience, doing anything real is hard enough, and even small tweaks can incur plenty of technical work, if that's a priority for you—</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Because it's uncomfortable to not know things (much less ask for help), you instead spend more time planning, imagining, worrying about problems two- and three- and four steps ahead.</li>
                <li>You say to yourself, &quot;I need to learn more about <em>X</em> before I start.&quot;</li>
                <li>You can't point to a few explorations of making small things or attempts toward sculpting your initial prototype.</li>

                <li>Tell yourself that you're going to throw this piece away, but that you're going to build it to either test out a piece of your project or learn how to do part of your project. Not everything needs to make it into the final cut.</li>
                <li>If you're not sure how to figure out which piece that is (or how to work on just one piece), ask us!</li>
                <li>Figure out a regular practice (of sharing mockups, )</li>

                <li>You haven't emailed looking for help.</li>
                <li>You haven't ended a session trying to get something work for a few hours frustrated. Or you haven't worked through a frustration after ending a session working frustrated.</li>

                <li>Ask to sit down and just play and explore—we <em>love</em> just sitting down to sketch and explore together, more like a jam session than a tennis lesson.</li>
