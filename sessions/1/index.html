    <h3>The next three weeks</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class='summary'>Three weeks isn't long to build something. As those who took the semester-long version of this course can attest, we felt rushed with more than fifteen weeks. To make the most of our time, try to immerse yourself in actually programming and working on your project(s). That can look different for different folks, but here are a few, good litmus tests…</p>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>brainstorming and publishing project inspirations, ideas, and refinements on your Github pages site <em>every day</em></li>
        <li>writing code—for your own projects or extensions and exercises from class—and pushing it to Github <em>every day</em></li>
        <li>meeting weekly milestones for your personal project, including:
            <ul style="font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
                <li><em>Week 1</em> — Finish a description, specification, and timeline for your final project</li>
                <li><em>Week 2</em> — Create a project demo, including description of what's left to finish for your final project</li>
                <li><em>Week 3</em> — Finish a first version of your final project</li>

    <p style='font-size:24px;'>To get our feet wet, let's take a stab at using HTML, CSS, and Javascript by populating the people page of the course site with our own information…</p>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an account at <a href="http://codepen.io">Codepen.io</a>.</li>
        <li>Fork <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">this Codepen</a> and modify it to be about you.</li>
        <li>Now, add some CSS or Javascript effects to your card. Check out <a href="http://dgmds15.github.io/people">our current people page</a> or <a href='https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e'>this list of effects</a> for inspiration on how to adapt your card.</li>
        <li>When you're done with your card, export it as a Github gist & post the link on your Github Pages site. We'll incorporate it into the class site from there.</li>

    <hr>
    <p style='font-size:24px;'>To get you thinking about what is possible with these digital tools and what it looks like to design something for another person, we will be looking at this sample project, presented as a gift last year. To look at its insides you will need to:</p>
    <hr>
    <ol style='font-size:22px;'>
        <li>Fork the the git repository by clicking "Fork" in the upper right of <a href="https://github.com/dgmds15/a-story-in-pomes">this page</a>.</li>
        <li>Now, clone the project by typing <span class='code'>git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/a-story-in-pomes.git</span> at your terminal.</li>
        <li>Change directory into the repository by typing <span class='code'>cd a-story-in-pomes</span> at your terminal.</li>
        <li>From inside the directory, run <span class='code'>git checkout gh-pages</span> to switch to the active branch of the project.</li>
        <li>Run <span class='code'>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</span>. You should now be able to go to <span class='code'>localhost:8000</span> in Google Chrome to view the website.</li>
        <li>Now, if you make changes to the project, you will see them reflected when you refresh this local page, but you will not effect the online version of the project. Try this out by opening the files you downloaded and changing one of the files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>For tomorrow</h2>
    <ol style='font-size: 0.625em;'>
        <li>Set up up your local development environment by following <a href="https://dgmds15.github.io/tools-and-materials">the steps here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Check out <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">this HTML/CSS/Javascript sketch</a> and take a look at our version of a digital business card. Make your own account, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/"><code>fork</code></a> our sketch, and replace Kanye's information and picture with your own. When you're done, try to add a new CSS or Javascript effect to your card on Codepen. You can look at <a href="http://dgmds15.github.io/people">the people page</a> on the current class site for some ideas or use <a href="https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e">this library of basic effects</a> for inspiration.</li>
        <li>To help you get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you work through the <code>/people</code> activity, please take a look at <a href="javascript-html-and-css-references">the HTML/CSS/JS section</a> of our Tools &amp; Materials page. You may want to begin with MDN's introductions to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS">CSS</a> and Shay Howe's <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS</a>. We'll also be digging into <a href="https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro">our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS</a>, which might be of particular use.</li>
        <li>When you're really <em>done</em> with your contribution to the people page, put the card into your Github pages site by <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/embedded-pens/">embedding the Codepen</a> into your Github Page (or <a href='https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/'>exporting the contents</a> from Codepen and integrating it directly, if you're comfortable).</li>
        <li>Tomorrow, we'll be looking a little more in depth at <a href="https://github.com/dgmds15/a-story-in-pomes">a-story-in-pomes</a>, so you might take a look at <a href="http://dgmds15.github.io/a-story-in-pomes/">the deployed version</a> to get a feel for the project before we dig into the nuts and bolts of its code.</li>
