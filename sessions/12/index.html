    <h4>Where are you at with your final project?</h4> 
    <small>Please write up the answers to these questions, and email us your answers and thoughts <i>tonight</i> before you leave.</small>  
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>What are you working on?  (<i>e.g.</i> What is your final project?)  Fill us in as much as we need based on previous conversations.</li>
        <li>What are you struggling with? and/or What do you anticipate struggling with?  Be as specific as you can.  We will use your answers to this question to tailor the materials we provide over the next few classes.</li>
        <li>What is your plan for 'finishing' your final project by May 7?  Please include a description of what you mean by 'finishing' -- <i>e.g.</i> what you are hoping to accomplish by the end of this class -- as well as week-by-week milestones that will get you there, keeping in mind:</li>
        <ul style="font-size:22px;">
            <li>April 23: ~90 minutes of in-class project work-time.</li>
            <li>April 30: ~90 minutes of in-class project work-time.</li>
            <li>May 7: Penultimate class & small-group demos/crits.</li>
            <li>May 14: Final class & project demos.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1><a href="http://tessel.io">Tessel.io</a></h1>   
    <ol>
        <li>Try running <code>tessel repl</code></a> in Terminal.  This will open <a href="https://tessel.io/docs/cli">a command line interface</a> which allows you to interactively control the Tessel.</li>
        <li>Try toggling and otherwise controlling the four LEDs on the Tessel board from the REPL.</li>
        <li>Display <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">the numbers 0–15</a> using the LEDs on the Tessel board.</li>
        <li>Light up an LED directly plugged into the Tessel.</li>
        <li>Control (4) by pressing a button.</li>
        <li>Use an LED <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/LEDs-as-light-sensors/">as a light sensor</a> and log its reading to the terminal at regular intervals.</li>
        <li>Blink the LEDs in (3) or (4) proportional to (6).</li>
        <li>Log out the readings from one of the modules that interest you in the terminal.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>For next week:</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol style="font-size: 0.65em;">
        <li>Expand on and revise your answers to, <a href="http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/12/#/6">"What are you working on?  What are you struggling with?  What would you like done for your final presentation?  For sessions 13, 14, and 15, What milestones do you need to hit by sessions 13, 14, and 15 get there?"</a></li>
        
        <li>If you think continuing to brainstorm final project ideas will help in either refining or discovering your final, final project, continue to do so!  Otherwise, we suggest redirecting your effort into spec'ing out, documenting, and completing your final project.</li>

        <li>Continue to work through the introductory Tessel extensions, especially if you anticipate using the Tessel in your final project.</li>
        
        <li>Work on the suggested extensions to the L3D cube interface, especially if you are interested in using the cube for your final project.</li>
        
        <li>A reminder: Each week, we'd love <a href='dgmde15.github.io/feedback'>your feedback</a> on the session!</li>

        <li>If you feel like you are struggling in any way and aren't sure you'll feel good about the final status of your final project, <i>please</i> reach out and let one of us know.  Even if you aren't sure what you need help with!</li>
