    <h1>Partner share-out</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Form a group of two or three — make sure there's at least one person who <em>doesn't</em> already know what your project is</li>
        <li>Take ~15 minutes for each person to give a test run of your share-out for Wednesday and then to debrief, taking note of people's comments and questions, as well as any bugs or challenges that may have popped up in your demo(s)</li>
        <li>Please feel free to leave this room to share-out — come back by 2PM</li>
        <li>Take a few minutes to make a TODO list from your notes and post them to your journal</li>
