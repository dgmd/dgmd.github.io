    <h2>Eight minutes to present</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You'll have <em>8 minutes</em>…</li>
        <li>…tell us the story of your project; it's not just about the finished product.</li>
        <li>One suggestion if you're struggling to think through the layout of those eight minutes:
            <ul>
                <li>Who is the audience (totally cool if it's you!)?</li>
                <li>What do you hope they'll get out of it?</li>
                <li>Why was it an interesting project to you?</li>
                <li>What can it do now?</li>
                <li>What do you want it to be able to do next, eventually?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you know you want to present to the class <em>or to us individually</em>, email us <em>right now</em>.</li>
    </ol>

<section>
    <h3>open studio time</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 0.65em;">
        <li>The rest of this class is going to be dedicated to getting you where you want to be with your final project(s).</li>
        <li>If you would like one of us to sit and chat, consult, debug, or brainstorm with you before you can meaningfully get started this evening, please flag one of us down.</li>
        <li>If you are still struggling to figure out the <i>form</i> your final project will take or when you should consider your project <i>finished</i>, check out <a href="http://104.236.253.62/t/project-specifications/41">this forum thread</a> about different types of project specifications and demos.</li>
        <li>Remember there are only two weeks left before <i>final presentation</i>, and one week until we're asking folks to have a 'functional' prototype ready to share as a <i>demo</i>.</li>
    </ul>
