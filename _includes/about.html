    <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/creative-explorations-screen-based-physical-computing/24025">This Harvard Extension School course</a> introduces computing as an expressive medium. We prototype, exhibit, and critique interactive, computational stories, art, and games presented as web applications and physical prototypes. We use JavaScript as a unifying language for programmatically controlling and combining audio, video, graphics, text, sensors, and actuators in these projects. Libraries like <a href='http://processingjs.org/'>Processing.js</a>, <a href='http://d3js.org/'>D3.js</a>, and <a href='http://snapsvg.io/'>Snap.svg</a> help us create data-rich, interactive visualizations, and <a href='http://tessel.io/'>Tessel</a> serves as the microcontroller platform for our physical computing work.
