an introduction to object oriented programming • pair programming on a more built-out version of [our Letterpress game](https://github.com/dgmde15/Letterpress/) (hosted [here](dgmde15.github.io/Letterpress) on GitHub) • 2+2 discussion (read more on sharing your 2+2's [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3)) • break-out time to work on and/or brainstorm personal projects

### For next week

1. Share your 2+2, read more on sharing your 2+2's [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3).

2. If you haven't had a chance, peruse [the game-related resources](http://104.236.253.62/t/games-game-playing-game-making/37) posted on Discourse; we'll be discussing them throughout the remainder of the program.

3. Explore the [Letterpress](http://github.com/dgmde15/Letterpress) and [OO Gallery](https://github.com/dgmde15/Object.Oriented.Gallery) micro-extensions you started this evening.

4. Continue working on your in-progress storytelling or personal projects.  If you have not had a chance to [email us](mailto:dgmde15@gmail.com) a check-in updating us as to what you're working on and would like help with, please do so!

5.  Next week, we'll have about ninety minutes in-class devoted to working on fleshing out your personal projects. To prepare, please update your `sketchbook.md` with a description of your final project ideas and/or your plan (however rough) for doing it.

6. A reminder: Each week, we'd love to hear [your feedback](dgmde15.github.io/feedback) on the session!
