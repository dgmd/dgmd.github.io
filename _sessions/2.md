submitting a pull request with some changes to your `/people` cards • introducing [our first, story-telling project](https://github.com/dgmde15/a-story-in-pomes), which can serve as the basis for your own work on this first project, either as inspiration or a code base • working through the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by taking a look at [a small gallery of HTML/CSS/JS effects](https://gist.github.com/8e881e01245989794c5e.git) which may offer some guidance and inspiration for your work on your cards • discussing some of the [the media and readings on story and storytelling](http://104.236.253.62/t/stories-storytelling/28)

### For next week
1. Please be sure to _fork_ ([documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S_526C8Gkw)) [our dgmde15.github.io repository](https://github.com/dgmde15/dgmde15.github.io), _clone_ it to your machine, _modify_ `assets/people.css` and `people/index.html`, and then _submit a pull request_ ([documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQsBmnZvBdc)) to us with your card.  Your modifications should minimally:
    * Change the title to your name
    * Only affect `assets/people.css` and `people/index.html`
    * All your modifications in `assets/people.css` should be grouped together and prefixed with `#name` where `name` is replaced with whatever name you'd like— We suggest your GitHub username.
You are, of course, welcome to make other modifications (_e.g._ including your own picture for the background, _etc._), using the other cards and the [HTML/CSS/JS gallery gist](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e) for guidance and inspiration.
