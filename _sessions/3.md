2+2 discussion (read more on sharing your 2+2's [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3)) • unpacking how [`a-story-in-pomes`](https://github.com/dgmde15/a-story-in-pomes) works • learning to host media on Amazon S3 and switching your profile photo over to S3 • discussion and digging into [the first extension of `a-story-in-pomes`](https://github.com/dgmde15/a-story-in-pomes#extension-1--change-background-image--content)


### For next week

1. Share your weekly 2+2 via however you're comfortable (read more on how to share [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3)): two cool projects made by other people and two project ideas you've come up with yourself

2. If you haven't already, copy the photo for your card from wherever it is hosted now (_e.g._ Facebook, twitter) to your Amazon S3 account.  You can find a written guide [here](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/amazon-s3-the-beginners-guide/) and video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRUzevLibzQ)

3. Begin digging into a first project—this could be extensions to the `pomes` project or a project of your own design.  Keep in mind that we'd like you share a demo or check in with us on the progress of this project by 2/26.

4. If you'd like to review some of the ideas and skills Shaunalynn began digging into as she walked through the `pomes` project, check out [this basic HTML/CSS/JS walkthrough](https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro) (including a video) from last year.

5. Please be sure to dig through [the readings on stories and storytelling](http://104.236.253.62/t/stories-storytelling/28); we'll be discussing them in more depth next week.

6. And finally, if you're still working to wrap your head around Git and GitHub, we suggest you take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4) and walk through [this tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).  If you'd like to read more about pull requests in particular, check out [GitHub's guide](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and [their video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQsBmnZvBdc)
