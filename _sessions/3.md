discussing what makes for good stories in the first place, and what role [if any] technology can play • dipping our toes into the technical guts of [our first, story-telling project](https://github.com/dgmde15/a-story-in-pomes) • working independently on `/people`, `pomes` extensions, and beginning to spec your projects

### For tomorrow

### Doing

1.  Set up [your GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/) and on it, link us to the gist of your `/people` card
2.  Be sure to set up your GitHub page and link us to your CodePen on it, exploring [the HTML/CSS/JS Gallery](https://github.com/dgmds15/html-css-js-gallery) as it seems useful.
3.  Dig into [Shaunalynn's pomes project](https://github.com/dgmde15/a-story-in-pomes) and the provided extensions.
4.  Share a draft of your project description or some brainstormed project ideas on your Github page.

### Reading

1.  [A few resources on stories and storytelling](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/11ff4be3cf5b861c4748) that might be evocative in considering what these technologies can do for your project(s).
2.  [Shay Howe's introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
3.  MDN's introductions to [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS) and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML)
4.  Walk through [GitHub's introductory `git` tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)[This video introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4)
5.  [This overview](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/part1/) of Chrome's Developer Tools; try playing with them to modify and tweak some of the effects in [the gallery](https://github.com/dgmds15/html-css-js-gallery) we touched on today.
