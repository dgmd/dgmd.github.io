digging into Michelle's Space Invaders • a discussion of digital tools & computation and their role in art- and art-making • an introduction to Bakhtiar's broswer-based interface to the L3D cube • exploring how we can control the cube and what we can make with it through coding.


### For next week

1. Mess around with the extensions to the <a href='https://github.com/dgmde15/3D-GIF'>browser-based L3D interface</a>.  See if you can get them working, and let us know if you run into challenges.
        
2. Explore the materials on Discourse about digital art-,art-making, and LED art.  Come in next week with some ideas of digital art project(s) you'd like to make and some sense of why they're exciting to you.
        
3. Share your 2+2 (you can read more on sharing your 2+2's <a href='http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3'>here</a>)
        
4. A reminder: Each week, we'd love <a href='dgmde15.github.io/feedback'>your feedback</a> on the session!
