2+2 discussion (read more on sharing your 2+2's [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3)) • discussion of Storytelling [readings and media](http://104.236.253.62/t/stories-storytelling/28/5) • [Tessel.io](https://tessel.io/) demo • discussion of 'getting your hands dirty' with code

### For next week

1. Share your weekly 2+2 via however you're comfortable (read more on how to share [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3)): two cool projects made by other people and two project ideas you've come up with yourself

2. Continue working on your storytelling project, `a-story-in-pomes` extensions, or whatever other project you've cooked up.  Prepare to either demo your project or to check-in with us (by email or otherwise) about where you're at with your project(s) thus far by next week.

3. If you are interested in exploring the physical computing aspects of this course, take a go at getting the Tessel up and running on your own computer.  Remember we are available by email, appointment, or during the weekend sessions to help you with this--or anything else you are struggling with.
