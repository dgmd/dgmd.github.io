Our first session will be spent investigating the question: Why do people code? We will spend our time • getting a sense of the people in the room and why *we* want to code • getting our machines set up with [the tools we’ll need](tools-and-materials) to work throughout the semester • taking our first stab at building something using HTML, CSS, and Javascript by designing & deploying the first version of our own personal website + a digital business card to live on [the people page](people) of our course site with information about who we are.


### For next week

1. Set up up your local development environment by following [the steps here](https://dgmds15.github.io/tools-and-materials).  Please try to have this done for tomorrow!
1. You should have already created your own github account and github user site, located at [YourUserName.github.io](), in the last step.  Try putting at least a title and some basic information on the site, but you don't have to worry about more than that for now.  
1. Check out this HTML/CSS/Javascript sketch on [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy) and take a look at our version of a digital business card.  Make your own account, `fork` our sketch, and replace Kanye's information and picture with your own.  When you're done, try to add a new CSS or Javascript effect to your card on Codepen.  You can look at [the people page](http://dgmds15.github.io/people) on the current class site for some ideas or use [this library of basic effects]() for inspiration.
1. To help you get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you work through the `/people` activity, please take a look at [the HTML/CSS/JS section](javascript-html-and-css-references) of our Tools &amp; Materials page.  You may want to begin with  MDN's introductions to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS) and Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).  We'll also be digging into [our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro), which might be of particular use.
1. When you're really *done* with your contribution to the people page, put the card into your Github pages site either by embedding the Codepen into your Github Page or by exporting your Codepen and incorporating it into the Github repository for your site.
1. Tomorrow, we'll be looking a little more in depth at [a-story-in-pomes](https://github.com/dgmds15/a-story-in-pomes), so you might take a look at [the deployed version](http://dgmds15.github.io/a-story-in-pomes/) to get a feel for the project before we dig into the nuts and bolts of its code.
