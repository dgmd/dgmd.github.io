Why do people code? • meet each other and discuss why *we* want to code • setting up our machines with [the tools we’ll need](tools-and-materials) • taking our first stab at playing with HTML, CSS, and Javascript by creating a digital card to live on [the people page](people) of our course site • setting up our own [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/) for the course

### For tomorrow

1. Set up up your local development environment by following [the steps here](https://dgmds15.github.io/tools-and-materials).  Please try to have this done for tomorrow!
2. You should have already created your own github account and github user site, located at `username.github.io`, in the last step.  Try putting at least a title and some basic information on the site, but you don't have to worry about more than that for now.  
3. Check out [this HTML/CSS/Javascript sketch](http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy) and take a look at our version of a digital business card.  Make your own account, [`fork`](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) our sketch, and replace Kanye's information and picture with your own.  When you're done, try to add a new CSS or Javascript effect to your card on Codepen.  You can look at [the people page](http://dgmds15.github.io/people) on the current class site for some ideas or use [this library of basic effects](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e) for inspiration.
4. To help you get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you work through the `/people` activity, please take a look at [the HTML/CSS/JS section](javascript-html-and-css-references) of our Tools &amp; Materials page.  You may want to begin with  MDN's introductions to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS) and Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).  We'll also be digging into [our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro), which might be of particular use.
5. When you're really *done* with your contribution to the people page, put the card into your Github pages site either by [embedding the Codepen](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/embedded-pens/) into your Github Page or [exporting the Codepen](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/) and integrating the code directly, if you're comfortable.
6. Tomorrow, we'll be looking a little more in depth at [a-story-in-pomes](https://github.com/dgmds15/a-story-in-pomes), so you might take a look at [the deployed version](http://dgmds15.github.io/a-story-in-pomes/) to get a feel for the project before we dig into the nuts and bolts of its code.
