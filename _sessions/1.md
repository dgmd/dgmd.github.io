Our first session will be spent investigating the question: Why do people code? We will spend out time • getting a sense of the people in the room and why *we* want to code • getting our machines set up with [the tools we’ll need](tools-and-materials) to work throughout the semester • taking our first stab at building something using HTML, CSS, and Javascript by designing our own digital business card to live on [the people page](people) of our course site with information about who we are.


### For next week

1. Set up up your local development environment by [the steps here](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/ec3e2f68b9ab8b2614a1) - this is the process we began in the first class session.
1. Before you begin exploring modifications to the `/people` page on your own machine, make sure that you have *forked* the [class website repo](https://github.com/dgmde15/dgmde15.github.io) to your own Github account. More info on how to fork can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) with a video walkthrough [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jGUFpWYm60).
1. Once you have forked the class website repo, *clone* a copy to your computer so you can run a local version of the site and make changes to the site files. Instructions for this are part of [the steps here](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/ec3e2f68b9ab8b2614a1). You should be able to open Google Chrome, navigate to [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) and see the course site pages (and any changes you may make to them).
1. After following the steps above, you should prepared to contribute to the site! During next week's session we'll walk through more of the background and skills needed to complete the process of adding yourself to the [`/people`](http://dgmde15.github.io/people/) page on the course website.
1. But, if you want to go ahead with the next steps: you'll be modifying the `people/index.html` file by adding a `div` element with an `id` specific to your name. Then, modify the `assets/css/people.css` file and add styling to your `id`. You can use the existing code as as a template.
1. To help you get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you work through the `/people` activity, please take a look at [the HTML/CSS/JS section](javascript-html-and-css-references) of our Tools &amp; Materials page.  You may want to begin with  MDN's introductions to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS) and Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).  We'll also be digging into [our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro) which you might like to check out.
1. Next week we're going to begin our discussions of storytelling and [the story project](https://github.com/dgmde15/Story-Project-1), so you might like to take a look at [the deployed version](http://dgmde15.github.io/Story-Project-1/).
1. As part of our initial conversations about stories, we'd like you to begin working through through some of the readings and videos [in this forum thread](http://104.236.253.62/t/stories-storytelling/28)…which is where we'll continue to develop and flesh out our discussions of 'story' through examples and more readings as this program continues.
1. We'd like you to make sure you sign up for the [Discourse forum](http://dgmde15.github.io/forum) and check out the [final projects](http://104.236.253.62/t/final-project-ideas/29) and [inspirations](http://104.236.253.62/t/real-world-inspirations/30) topics.  You'll find further directions for sharing in each of those, but basically we'd like you to come up with the seeds of two final project ideas and two examples of projects or products you think are especially interesting.
1. And finally, one last weekly habit: we'd like to solicit your feedback each week on how the previous week's session went.  You can find a form where you can do that [anonymously] [here](/feedback).  Please share what you think about the course so far, and pull no punches.
