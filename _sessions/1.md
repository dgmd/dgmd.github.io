Why do people code? • setting up our machines with [the tools we’ll need](tools-and-materials) • taking our first stab at playing with HTML, CSS, and Javascript by creating a digital card in <a href="http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy">Codepen</a> to live on [the people page](people) of our course site • setting up our own [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/) for the course

### For next week

1. Set up up your local development environment by following [the steps here](https://dgmd.github.io/tools-and-materials).  Please try to have this done for next week! We will be available for studio hours at [Clover in Harvard Square](https://www.cloverfoodlab.com/location-and-hours/) on Saturday morning from 9AM-1PM to help if you're stuck—or just want to hang out.
2. You should have already created your own github account and github user site, located at `username.github.io`, in the last step.  Try putting at least a title and some basic information on the site. (You don't have to worry about more than that for now.)  
3. Check out [this HTML/CSS/Javascript sketch](http://codepen.io/duffles/pen/EjQLzy) and take a look at our version of a digital business card.  Make your own account, `fork` our sketch, and replace Kanye's information and picture with your partner's.  When you're done, try to add a new CSS or Javascript effect to the card on Codepen.  You can look at [the people page](http://dgmds15.github.io/people) on the current class site for some ideas or use [this library of basic effects](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e) for inspiration.
4. To help you get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you work through the `/people` activity, please take a look at [the HTML/CSS/JS section](javascript-html-and-css-references) of our Tools &amp; Materials page.  You may want to begin with  MDN's introductions to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS) and Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).  We'll also be digging into [our own intro to and demo of the basics of HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro), which might be of particular use.
