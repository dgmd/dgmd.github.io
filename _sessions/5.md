2+2 discussion (read more on sharing your 2+2's [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3)) • discussion of the games we love and why we love them • introduction to the game [Letterpress](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8) • collaborative coding to build [our own version of Letterpress](https://github.com/dgmde15/Letterpress/) (hosted [here](dgmde15.github.io/Letterpress) on GitHub) 

### For next week

1. Please <b>email us a status update</b> about where you are with the projects you have undertaken before next week's class.  This can be an informal check-in, but we would love to know a.) what you're finding challenging, b.) what you hope to accomplish, c.) how we can be more helpful to you, and d.) in what ways--if at all--you've made use of the code examples and tutorials we've provided so far.  This is so we know where you're at 1/3 of the way into the course and to help us understand what we're providing is most helpful to you all.
1. Share your weekly 2+2 via however you’re comfortable (read more on how to share here): two cool projects made by other people and two project ideas you’ve come up with yourself.
1. If it's up your alley, try to finish up the piece of the Letterpress micro-extensions you started this evening.  Remember to <code>fork</code> [the DGMDE-15 repository](https://github.com/dgmde15/Letterpress), <code>checkout</code> the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, and <code>push</code> changes to your own forked branch.  Let us know if you are having trouble and want us to check out your code!
1. Peruse [the game-related resources shared on Discourse](http://104.236.253.62/t/games-game-playing-game-making/37/3).
