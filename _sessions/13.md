sharing project ideas for feedback • discussing the plan and timeline for the final weeks of class • in-class studio time for final projects

### For next week
1. Expand on and revise your answers to, <a href="http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/12/#/6">"What are you working on?  What are you struggling with?  What would you like done for your final presentation?  For sessions 13, 14, and 15, What milestones do you need to hit by sessions 13, 14, and 15 get there?"</a>

1. If you think continuing to brainstorm final project ideas will help in either refining or discovering your final, final project, continue to do so!  Otherwise, we suggest redirecting your effort into spec'ing out, documenting, and completing your final project.

1. A reminder: Each week, we'd love <a href='dgmde15.github.io/feedback'>your feedback</a> on the session!

1. If you feel like you are struggling in any way and aren't sure you'll feel good about the final status of your final project, <i>please</i> reach out and let one of us know.  Even if you aren't sure what you need help with!
