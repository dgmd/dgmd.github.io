refining [Letterpress](https://github.com/dgmde15/Letterpress) (along with [some minor interface techniques](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/f08279e380a06020c9b3)) &bull; brainstorming and sharing some project feedback &bull; articulating next steps for your project &bull; pair programming and pair-designing on your final project &bull; RFSR (Request For Screencast Requests)

1.  *Send us [your next steps](#next-steps)*, including your screencast request:

	+ Who is the audience?
	+ What are they supposed to feel, to get out of the project?
	+ What does the result look like?
	+ What's your plan for getting there? (Or at least, the next steps?)
	+ What are you stuck on or struggling with?
	+ If you could see a screencast of how to do one thing, what would you lke to see?


2.  *Flesh out the first draft of a spec for your final project.* We'll be posting more resources on doing this to the forum, but in the meantim you can begin with with these: ["Story Map"](https://medium.com/design-story/story-map-3cc64033128e); ["Sketching with a Sharpie"](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/466-sketching-with-a-sharpie); ["Painless Functional Specifications"](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html) (note there are four parts); Personal Design Sprint [\#1](http://franciscortez.com/design-sprint/), [\#2](https://medium.com/@makeshowlearn/personal-design-sprint-ii-food-tracking-af853a78a210), and [\#3](https://medium.com/@makeshowlearn/personal-design-sprint-iii-prompts-10949cc4cf6b); and ["Your Best Agile User Story"](http://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-story/)

3.  Share your 2+2 (you can read more on sharing your 2+2's [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3))

4.  Peruse [the game-related media](http://104.236.253.62/t/games-game-playing-game-making/37) posted on Discourse.

5.  Work on the [Letterpress](http://github.com/dgmde15/Letterpress) extensions which feel useful to you; you may find [this gist](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/f08279e380a06020c9b3) of some sample drag, drop, and click behaviors useful.

6.  A reminder: Each week, we'd love [your feedback](http://dgmde15.github.io/feedback) on the session!
