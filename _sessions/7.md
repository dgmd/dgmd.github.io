refining and extending Letterpress to the physical &bull; brainstorming and sharing some project feedback &bull; articulating next steps for your project &bull; pair programming and pair-designing on your final project &bull; RFSR (Request For Screencast Requests)

<!-- ### For next week

1. Share your 2+2, read more on sharing your 2+2's [here](http://dgmde15.github.io/sessions/2/#/3).

2. If you haven't had a chance, peruse [the game-related resources](http://104.236.253.62/t/games-game-playing-game-making/37) posted on Discourse; we'll be discussing them throughout the remainder of the program.

3. [Email us](mailto:dgmde15@gmail.com) the [link to] a summary of the status of your project—In particular:

+ Who is the audience?
+ What are they supposed to feel, to get out of the project?
+ What does the result look like?
+ What's your plan? (Or at least, the next steps?) What are you stuck on or struggling with?
+ When could you sit down with us (or Skype)?

4. [Email us](mailto:dgmde15@gmail.com) your screencast requests—_i.e._ if you'd like to see how something is done, let us know!  But try to be specific, _e.g._ "Could you make a small version of Pong from scratch?" is better than, "How could I make a game?" but "Can you walk through styling a paddle and controlling it with the keyboard?" is even better.

5. If you'd like to get together with us to chat about your project (anything from scoping to debugging), email us!

6. Email us!

7. Email us!

8. A reminder: Each week, we'd love to hear [your feedback](dgmde15.github.io/feedback) on the session!
