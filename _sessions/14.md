title: Project Feedback & Open Studio Time

sharing project ideas for feedback • discussing the plan and timeline for the final weeks of class • in-class studio time for final projects

### For next week
1. Come in with a 'demo-able' version of your final project to be shared with a small group during next week's session.  Your demo might look different depending on the form your project(s) have taken.  Feel free to have people download your code to try something you want to see people work back, share the story behind your project and how it fits into your development as a programmer, artist, etc.  Or just send people to a URL and have them experience a site you've created.  If you are unsure how to best use this time next week, please grab one of us to figure it out.

1. If you would like one of us to sit and chat, consult, debug, or brainstorm with you before you can meaningfully get started this evening, please <a href="mailto:dgmde15@gmail.com">let us know</a>.

1. A reminder: Each week, we'd love <a href='dgmde15.github.io/feedback'>your feedback</a> on the session!
