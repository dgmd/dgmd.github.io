sharing final project presentation drafts in small groups for feedback

### For next week

1.  Send us a link to [your GitHub User Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages) (or some other, online document) with a listing of *all the materials* you think sum up your time with us by **11:59PM on Tuesday, 12 May 2015**.

2.  Email us your answer to, "What state would you like your project in for your final presentation?"

3.  We know we've asked for a lot of feedback already. But, this is the last time, promise! Please go [here](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/course-evaluations) and fill out the evaluation by **11:59PM on Monday, 19 May**.

4.  Next week we're going to ask you to help us out by writing out your own version of the course descriptionâ€¦something you think would better or more effectively represent this course. So please begin thinking about this!

5.  And finally, if you feel like you are struggling in any way and aren't sure you'll feel good about the status of your final project, *please* let one of us know. Even if you aren't sure what you need, we'd like to get together!
