        Our course will be structured around creating four gifts. Throughout the course, we will try to consistently return to the act of empathy that’s at the core of good design. This involves articulating whom the audience for your project is, what will satisfy them, what you want them to feel, how they’ll use your project, and so on. To us, gifts are among the most charming realizations of that impulse.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first gift will be an interactive story (developed over week 1); the next gift will be a game (developed during week 2); the final gift will be one of your own conception and creation (designed throughout the course with explicit class time dedicated during week 3). Each of these genres (story and game) is a deeply human activity: we have been telling stories and playing games and giving gifts since time immemorial. Each of our projects will have digital and physical components and suggested extensions. For each project, we’ll also explore our driving questions of “Why?” and “For whom?” (and their corollary, “What defines quality?”) for each genre. You’re encouraged to use each sample project we provide as a jumping-off point but should not feel constrained by what’s provided.

    <h2 id="gift-one-interactive-story">Gift One: Interactive Story</h2>

    <p>
        The first gift we design and develop together will be one that tells a story. At first blush, the word story might pigeonhole itself as fiction or folklore, but the power of narrative to inspire and entertain has as many ancient forms as it does modern. Services like Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat collect our words, images, videos, and other artifacts of our digital interactions to construct “stories” aiming to tell the narratives of our lives and relationships. In the world of journalism and civic media, amplifying the “stories” of individuals and communities over those of money and politics is the basis of much talk and dreaming. Big data and data visualization even promise to tell system-level narratives, helping us to tell the “stories” we can only see by zooming out and observing large-scale trends and patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether you receive these new forms of story-telling with skepticism, excitement, or something in between, we want to use this first project as an opportunity to explore the many different forms a story can take and the new storytelling experiences now possible natively within the browser and with physical extensions supported by modern browsers. We hope you will follow your own interests and aesthetic sensibilities as you develop a story-based project of your own design.
    </p>

    <p>
        To serve as inspiration, we’d like to offer a few examples of story-based projects we love including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall">Snowfall</a>, a 2012 New York Times news story put together with interactive media elements embedded throughout, <a href="http://mailchimp.com/2013">this 2013 annual report</a> by Mail Chimp telling the story of their company's year by bringing numbers to life, <a href="http://www.the-bea.st/">The Beast</a>, a poem by Laura Marling with accompanying illustration and audio animated in the browser for an interactice, storytelling experience, and <a href="http://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014">The Coming Out Simulator</a> an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure style story told via text message exploring the challenges of coming out.
    </p>

    <p>
        To get you started on the actual coding, we will also provide you with a project we've built by scratch, telling the story of a relationship through poems, texts, pictures, audio recordings, and videos collected over weeks and months, put together in a scrapbook form that can be viewed based on geography, time and date, or other user-generated tags through a screen and physical interface.  You will have access to all the code and physical elements to recreate and extend this project into one that is meaningful to you and someone you care about.

    <h2 id="gift-two-computational-art">Gift Two: Computational Art</h2>

    <p>
        Seymour Papert and colleagues have established a revolutionary and fertile foundation for understanding how design of computational tools can profoundly change the nature of people’s contact with science and mathematics. The book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465046746/'><i>Mindstorms</i></a> offered a bold vision for computers "<a href="http://www.papert.org">as instruments for learning and for enhancing creativity</a>." The book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262010631/'><i>Turtle Geometry</i></a> convincingly and beautifully demonstrated the character, depth, rigor of the mathematical work that is possible through writing simple programs for exploring space by following an imaginary turtle across the screen. Mindstorms has inspired and led to an array of important computational tools for democratizing access to powerful ideas in engineering, science, mathematics, and art: <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/">Lego Mindstorms</a>, <a href="http://www.microworlds.com">LCSI MicroWorlds</a>, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">MIT Scratch</a>, and <a href="http://turtleart.org">Turtle Art</a>. The idea for the Gift Two project was inspired by Turtle Art and projects like it.
    </p>

    <p>
        John Maeda combined techniques and ideas from computation and traditional visual art to create works that have been widely recognized as inspiring—and, thanks to the broad popularity of tools like the <a href="http://www.processing.org/">processing</a> programming language and the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">arduino</a> physical computing platform developed by his students and colleagues, shaping—the way the internet and digital media look today. Selected works by John Maeda that are featured in the <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=30299">permanent collection</a> of the Museum of Modern Art and the <a href="http://www.maedastudio.com/">Maeda Studio</a> site may offer additional inspirations for the computational art gifts that we will create.

    <h2 id="gift-three-game">Gift Two: Game</h2>

    <p>
        Boards have dominated many of our games—both physically, and as a metaphor—for millennia. From chess to Scrabble to Mousetrap, we love imagining alternative worlds on our tabletops. And boards offer us an easy way to build in subtle logic and structure: e.g. the grid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_checkers">Chinese Checkers</a> versus the winding paths of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Land">Candyland</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project and its extensions will explore how we can bring interaction into that classic medium. We're going to create a board which can sense and recognize individual pieces as well as interact with us through light and sound and use that board to revisit a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/24/3493440/letterpress-loren-brichter">recent hit</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8">Letterpress</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Letterpress is a two-player combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble">Scrabble</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>, meaning that as you place and create words, you also secure territory by surrounding letters you've used with other letters you've used. The game is over when all letters have been used, and whichever player has secured the most territory—i.e. cells—at that point wins. Although it was originally made for iOS and asynchronous gameplay, we're creating a physical version designed to be played casually, in realtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our board will be a 5x5 grid which has been equipped with contacts to allow us to sense the resistance of carefully placed resistors on the underside of our pieces. Although this particular design is a grid, the general principle and design we're using here can be easily adapted to allow for the registration and recognition of any shape or arrangement of pieces and placements.
    </p>

    <p>
        The implementation of this project and its suggested extensions focuses on an approach to arranging your code known as &quot;object-oriented programming,&quot; which can be an especially convenient way of organizing code which controls many, similarly behaving elements. In our case, those elements are the pieces (and the inputs and outputs associated with them).

    <h2 id='final-gift'>Final Gift</h2>

    <p>
        The stories and games we create throughout the course will culminate in your final project, wherein you’ll be asked to identify someone you care about—or perhaps someone you’ve just met through this course—and develop a gift for them. This means you’ll need to get to know them and their interests, articulate their sensibilities, and identify an opportunity to create an object which will make a difference (however small) in their lives.
