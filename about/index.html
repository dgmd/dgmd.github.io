        Our course will be structured around designing and building a gift as your final project. Throughout the three weeks of the course, we will try to consistently return to the act of empathy that’s at the core of good design. This involves articulating whom the audience for your project is, what will satisfy them, what you want them to feel, how they’ll use your project, and so on. To us, gifts are among the most charming realizations of that impulse.
    </p>

    <p>
        Three weeks isn't a very long time when you want to build something, especially if you don't have much experience using these tools and technologies.  It's possible, but it requires that you deeply immerse yourself in the processes of design and development for the full three weeks.  In order to come out of this course with something your truly excited about and proud of, we think you will need to do a few things.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>brainstorm and publish project inspirations, ideas, and refinements on your Github pages site every day</li> 
        <li>write code--for your own project, as extensions to class projects, or as exercises--and push it to Github every day</li>
        <li>meet each week's milestone based on your own goals for the course including:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Week 1</b> :: Write a description, specification, and timeline for your final project.</li>
            <li><b>Week 2</b> :: Create a project demo, including description of what's left to finish for your 'final' version.</li>
            <li><b>Week 3</b> :: "Finish" your project.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol>
    <p>To lay out this timeline and describe it in a little more detail...</p>

    <h2 id="week-1">Week 1: The Pomes Project</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Monday:</b> Our goal for the first day of class is "just" to make sure that everyone's computer is set up with the <a href="">Tools & Materials</a> you'll need for the next three weeks.  You'll need to follow <a href="">these instructions</a> to install things onto your computer, create a <a href="">Github account</a> if you don't already have one, create <a href="">a personal website</a> through Github Pages where you will journal and post work for this course daily, and join the course's <a href="">Slack Channel</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Tuesday:</b> On this day, we'll get started using the tools of the trade.  We'll have an intro to HTML, CSS, and Javascript and ask you each to create a personal entry on the <a href="">/people page</a> of the class website by forking the Github repository for the site, running it locally so you can make changes without affecting the actual site, writing your own HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create your personal entry, and then making a pull request to the site when your changes are complete.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Wednesday:</b> To get you started coding your own projects, we will provide you with a project we've built from scratch, telling the story of a relationship through poems, texts, pictures, audio recordings, and videos collected over weeks and months, put together in a scrapbook form that can be viewed based on geography, time and date, or other user-generated tags through a screen and physical interface.  You will have access to all the code and physical elements to recreate and extend this project into one that is meaningful to you and someone you care about.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Thursday:</b> Now that you have the basics under your control, we're going to ask you to figure out the project you want to complete by the end of this course.  We'll review what project specifications are and ask you to come in next week with a clear articulation of the project you want to build, what it will entail, and how you intend to approach it. 
        </li>

    <h2 id="week-2">Week 2: Programming Personal Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This week, we'll get started building your personal projects in earnest.  
        </li>
        <li>
            On Monday, we'll review your project specifications, debrief them, and dig into a technical challenge lifted from someone's personal project as a way to think about project design, specifications, and to get more experience programming.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each day, we'll spend some time brainstorming and giving feedback on people's project ideas, some time working through a technical challenge from someone's project, and some time coding in class.
        </li>
        <li>
            By the end of the week, everyone should have a clear sense of what they need to finish in order to give an informal demo and presentation of their project on Monday.
        </li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2 id="week-3">Week 3: Finishing Final Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Monday</b>: We'll start this week by giving in-class demos of personal projects, receiving feedback, and beginning to incorporate that feedback and finish the remaining pieces of the projects. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Tuesday & Wednesday</b>: These days will be dedicated to in-class coding time with technical support, advice, and brainstorming available throughout.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Thursday</b>: For our last day, we'll eat food, share our projects, and reflect on the past three weeks, taking some time to look forward at what next steps might remain for projects which are yet-to-be-finished.
        </li>
