        <p>If:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you are interested in becoming more fluent in making interactive digital and physical things with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
            <li><em>and</em> you feel comfortable committing to investing the time required to make it a valuable experience for you (in our experience, 10–15 hours weekly outside of class sessions)</li>
            <li><em>and</em> you're open to guidance in appropriately scoping your projects and expectations around those projects</li>
            <li><em>and</em> you're open not only to learning the skills involved in these projects, but the skill of learning these skills then absolutely!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or concerns about this, please don't hesitate to let us know…This program is unusual and different from many others in that our focus is on helping you to articulate, define, and achieve your own definitions of success; we don't come in with a particular agenda.
        </p>

        <h2 id="do-you-need-to-know-how-to-program">Do you need to know how to program?</h2>

        <h2 id="will-i-be-at-a-disadvantage-if-i-cant-program">Will I be at a disadvantage if I can't program?</h2>
        <p>
            Nope in at least two ways: 1) this program is intended for folks who've never programmed before, 2) it's not a competition!
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-should-i-set-my-goals-for-this-program">How should I set my goals for this program?</h2>
        <p>
            That's really up to you, but in our experience, the best use is made of this program when the participants:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>…articulate their longer term goals for themselves—are you looking to change careers? To make art? To just get a sense of what all this hubbub around coding is about? To build a personal portfolio? To…</li>
            <li>…are sensitive to scoping projects appropriately so that they feel complete and well-finished, even if they are smaller than originally intended</li>
            <li>…and above all, find ways to identify <em>authentic</em> projects for themselves.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="how-will-you-support-me-to-reach-my-goals">How will you support me to reach my goals?</h2>
        <p>
            We happen to know more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, physical computing, and perhaps the design process than most of the participants in this program. We see our role as making that expertise usefully available while offering a healthy structure within which folks can develop their own expertise. That means that we're happy to sit down and help you to brainstorm and scope projects appropriately, meet with you one-on-one <strong>at any time</strong> to discuss technical, design, or other questions or problems you encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Concretely, we'll also host studio sessions on Saturday from 9AM–1PM at Clover in Harvard Square where you can come and work on your projects, get one-on-one help, or work with other participants. We will also be scheduling regular, check-in meetings throughout the term to help you articulate and refine your project. If you have a question that isn't appropriate for those venues, you're always welcome to email the team at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or any of us, individually.

        <h2 id="how-will-we-be-graded">How will we be graded?</h2>
        <p>
            As is hopefully clear by this point, our goal is to help you meet your goals with respect to the technologies and skills touched on in this program. That means different goals for different people. There is no articulated, minimum technical bar people must reach. We hope that through ongoing discussion about you, your goals, and your projects throughout this course, you'll be able to articulate standards of success for yourself within which you can unambigously assess the quality, depth, and arc of your work as captured by your portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            More simply: you're all adults, in this program for a reason, and you know if you're doing the type of work you came here to do. We know grades can be stressful, but we want you to be able to deal with questions of self-assessment on your own, and are more than happy to sit down to talk through the inevitable discomfort that responsibility may cause.

        <p>
            If you're unsure, please don't hesitate to sit down with us to get feedback on the project, and importantly, its scope and timeline. In our experience, being able to <em>complete</em> a well-scoped project feels <em>far</em> better and teaches you much more than leaving a larger project unfinished. And it's hard to scope projects appropriately as a beginner, without something of a sherpa to give you a sense for the landscape's difficulty. Let us play that role! Check in with us regularly, articulate what you'd like to get done on what timeline, and don't hesitate to revise the project scope—it's not a sign of failure.

            No but, if you really want to, yes, as long as you realize that we will be less able to support you. We've chosen what we think are good tools that couple nicely together, and there is vanishingly little those other tools enable you to do which isn't possible with the default toolset.

        <p>
            Each week you'll find yourself dreading class. You'll momentarily consider the Saturday sessions, but feel like debugging is overwhelming and that you aren't really sure about what you want to be working on anyway. You'll choose projects that you aren't really interested in, but which you think will get you a good grade. You'll be too shy to ask for help. You'll excuse subpar work because we aren't forcing you to revise and polish your output.

            Each week you'll find yourself excited to come to class and will feel disappointed about any Saturday sessions you can't make. You'll consistently feel like you're getting a handle on new concepts and content and bending those to be useful to you. You'll be working on personally meaningful projects, producing work which you think is of the highest quality.

            Christopher Alexander (the famed architect) wrote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which inhibits young professionals, new students most severely, is their acceptance of standards that are too low. If I ask a student whether her design is as good as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me as if to say, "Of course not, that isn't what I am trying to do.... I could never do that."
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must be our standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard is worthwhile. That is what I expect of myself in my own buildings, and it is what I expect of my students." Gradually, I show the students that they have a right to ask this of themselves, and must ask this of themselves. Once that level of standard is in their minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do better, how to make something that is as profound as that.

            The specifics of the answer to this question depend on you and the projects you choose to do throughout this program. Minimally, we hope that you are left with the basic technical infrastructure and experience to begin messing about with these tools and ideas for your own purposes, comfortably self-identifying and self-starting projects of your own in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            But folks who've taken this course in the past have gone on to get jobs in front-end web development, entering the Digital Media program here at the extension school, building small websites for their department or company, and 'simply' beginning a personal practice of exploring and making small projects for themselves, their friends, and their family.

        <p>
            "Curriculum" comes from the Latin for "race course" (like for horses). That isn't what this program is. We hope it will be closer to a boxing gym—a place where people with a common interest come for many different motivations (health, self defense, competition, craftsmanship) and happily co-exist, teaching and working alongside one another with the help of more expert staff and some specialized equipment.

            You'll notice there aren't any deadlines listed. This is not an accident. There aren't any deadlines in this program. We intend for the projects to be prompts, inspiration, and scaffolding for you to learn with and climb around in.

            You can't rush love. Seriously: due dates are imposed by you. Much of what we'd like you to get good at is scoping projects. And given that much of the premise of this program is that we'd like to see making things with technology become a meaningful part of your life, it seems like it'd be weird for us to define that sometimes, life happens and intervenes!

        <p>
